Always make sure to confirm how long it takes for your tokens to expire. This can be done by asking in the TosiDrop Telegram and Discord support channels.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-guides/how-can-I-add-my-pool-or-token-project":{"id":"user-guides/how-can-I-add-my-pool-or-token-project","title":"How can I add my pool or token project?","description":"We\u2019ll soon announce how tokens can be distributed on our platform.

Based on this data tokens are accumulated to each delegate account inside of TosiDrop, based on their staking address. Community members can claim their rewards each epoch or allow their tokens to accumulate and then claim.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-guides/how-much-it-cost":{"id":"user-guides/how-much-it-cost","title":"How much does it cost?","description":"There is a service fee (0.1\u20b3) deducted from the withdrawal deposit, that goes to Seal Pool, who developed the backend of the platform. There may be additional service fees outside of claiming LISO rewards from anetaBTC. Final TX cost depends on rewards. If the pool is distributing ADA and the delegate accumulated more than min UTXO size + min TX fee (1.4ADA) then the withdrawal cost is only the service fee + TX fees (0.36 \u20b3). In case there isn\'t enough ADA accumulated, but there are some tokens available that the delegate wants to withdraw, they still have the option to do it, but they need to cover the TX fees by sending a UTXO deposit to TosiDrop. Tokens and most of ADA will be returned back to them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-guides/i-sent-ada-and-got-nothiig-back":{"id":"user-guides/i-sent-ada-and-got-nothiig-back","title":"I sent ADA and got nothing back","description":"TosiDrop is very careful with deposits, and sometimes it happens that withdrawal can\'t be executed. For example, is a deposit has the wrong size (is smaller than necessary), or the user accidentally sends the deposit to a custom withdrawal address, without actually making a custom withdrawal, TosiDrop will not know which tokens they wanted. In these cases, your ADA deposit is added in form of a never-expiring reward to your staking address and can be withdrawn back during the next (valid) request.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"user-guides/what-if-i-send-wrong-amount-of-ada":{"id":"user-guides/what-if-i-send-wrong-amount-of-ada","title":"What if I send the wrong amount of ADA?","description":"Your ADA won\'t be lost, in case you send more than the requested TX fee deposit, the system will automatically send you back all extra ADA as part of your reward. So you will get back the exact same amount you sent minus transaction fees. In case you send less than the requested deposit of 2ADA, the system will consider it a mistake on your side, and again send you ADA back, but this time only ADA, because TX including native assets is expensive and this wouldn\'t cover it. If you send less than 1ADA + tx fees, the system will not send anything back to you, but it will add this amount to your reward bonus, so you will get it back during the next withdrawal.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
