# Glossary

**Wrapping**:
 The process of taking a token on an existing blockchain and tokenizing it on another blockchain. This helps with blockchain interoperability. We'll be wrapping BTC on Ergo & Cardano blockchains.

**Bridge**: A Blockchain bridge forms a link that allows tokens and/or data to travel from one chain to another.

**Smart Contract**: Like any contract, smart contracts establish terms of an agreement. What distinguishes smart contracts from traditional contracts is that the established terms are in the form of code running on a blockchain, as opposed to a contract drawn up by a lawyer.

**Vault**: Vaults are responsible for the anetaBTC bridge. They maintain the physical 1:1 peg between BTC and anetaBTC. Vaults receive BTC for safekeeping from users and ensure BTC remains locked while anetaBTC exists.

**Mint**: Lock BTC to unlock anetaBTC.

**Redeem**: Lock anetaBTC to unlock BTC.

**Burn**: Lock anetaBTC to unlock ERG.

**Security Deposit**: The amount of colleratal that must be locked by a vault to ensure proper intent to engage with the protocol.
