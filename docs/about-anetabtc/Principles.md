# Core Principles

AnetaBTC is a fully on-chain, decentralized protocol that
allows Bitcoin to be directly wrapped on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains. 
AnetaBTC enables Bitcoin holders to unlock the value of their assets in a secure and efficient environment to provide yield, 
without selling any Bitcoin, and without any third-party custodian involvement.


Our mission is that we are working to enrich regular people through the most secure and easy way to use an asset wrapping protocol on Ergo and Cardano.


Our vision is to deliver world class DeFi experiences safely, securely, and maximally decentralized.
