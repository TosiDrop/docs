# Introduction

The technology at the heart of Bitcoin, Cardano, and Ergo is [blockchain](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain). This technology is simply an open, distributed ledger that records transactions between two parties efficiently and in a verifiable and permanent way.

Blockchain technology is based on decentralization; that is, the dispersion or distribution of functions and powers to the many, rather than just a few.

Decentralization allows the record-keeping of shared databases with anyone in the world without any intermediary involvement and assures protection from deletion, tampering, and revision.

The power of the many is what allows cryptocurrencies to have value. Therefore, having wide distribution to as large a community of like-minded individuals as possible is crucial in creating genuinely decentralized projects for the future.

Furthermore, decentralization from the early stages of development for new projects allows the project’s community to enjoy the growth in the value of new projects rather than just insiders and corporate interests.

TosiDrop is an all-encompassing token distribution platform on the Cardano and Ergo blockchains — the two most decentralized blockchains in existence.

With TosiDrop, any project can seamlessly distribute tokens to its community members by 1) Directly airdropping tokens to a collected list of addresses, or 2) By allowing their community to claim tokens via vending machine mechanism.
