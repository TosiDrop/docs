# Introduction

TosiDrop is an all-encompassing token distribution platform on the Cardano and Ergo blockchains â€” the two most decentralized blockchains in existence.

With TosiDrop, any project can seamlessly distribute tokens to its community members by 1) Directly airdropping tokens to a collected list of addresses, or 2) By allowing their community to claim tokens via vending machine mechanism.



POLICY ID for tokens:
