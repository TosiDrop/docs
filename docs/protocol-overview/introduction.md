# Introduction

AnetaBTC is a research-driven protocol. The birth of AnetaBTC is the combination of concepts from research papers including, but not limited to, Bitcoin, wBTC, [REN](https://renproject.io/), [Ergo](https://ergoplatform.org/), and [Interlay](https://Interlay.io). The key part of our approach is writing smart contracts that send Bitcoin to a vault if a user wants to mint anetaBTC. Upon minting, users will be able to freely use anetaBTC as a Bitcoin-backed asset on the Ergo and Cardano blockchains.
