# What if I send the wrong amount of ADA?

Your ADA won't be lost, in case you send more than the requested TX fee deposit, the system will automatically send you back all extra ADA as part of your reward. So you will get back the exact same amount you sent minus transaction fees. In case you send less than the requested deposit of 2ADA, the system will consider it a mistake on your side, and again send you ADA back, but this time only ADA, because TX including native assets is expensive and this wouldn't cover it. If you send less than 1ADA + tx fees, the system will not send anything back to you, but it will add this amount to your reward bonus, so you will get it back during the next withdrawal.
