# NETA and cNETA Benefits

Holders of NETA and cNETA, collectively, have the following benefits:

100% Governance of the anetaBTC protocol;
100% Revenue-sharing of all protocol transaction fees;
100% Ownership of NETA Liquidity Fund via LISO; and
100% Ownership of campaign rewards earned from our DEX partners: ErgoDEX and Minswap.

As anetaBTC is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), any majority vote of anetaBTC governance tokens, NETA and cNETA, will dictate the future direction of the anetaBTC protocol, including the ability to liquidate the NETA Liquidity Fund into the hands of all NETA holders, proportional to their ownership interest. Therefore, as the value of assets held by the NETA Liquidity Fund hopefully increases over time, NETA holders should realize an increase in the value of their NETA position.
