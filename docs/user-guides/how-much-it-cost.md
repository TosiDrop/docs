# How much does it cost? 

For premium tokens, there is a service fee 0.5₳ that goes toward TosiDrop revenue. There is also a fee of 0.1₳ that goes to Seal Pool, who developed the backend. Typically, TosiDrop will require the user to send 2.4₳, and you will receive ~1.53₳ back. The other fees (~0.3₳) come from the Cardano network.

For non-premium tokens, there is no 0.5₳ service fee. This means TosiDrop will require the user to send 1.9₳, and you will receive ~1.53₳ back. The other fees (~0.3₳) come from the Cardano network.
