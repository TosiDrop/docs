# How much does it cost? 

There is a service fee (0.1₳) deducted from the withdrawal deposit, that goes to Seal Pool, who developed the backend of the platform. There may be additional service fees outside of claiming LISO rewards from anetaBTC. Final TX cost depends on rewards. If the pool is distributing ADA and the delegate accumulated more than min UTXO size + min TX fee (~1.4ADA) then the withdrawal cost is only the service fee + TX fees (~0.36 ₳). In case there isn't enough ADA accumulated, but there are some tokens available that the delegate wants to withdraw, they still have the option to do it, but they need to cover the TX fees by sending a UTXO deposit to TosiDrop. Tokens and most of ADA will be returned back to them.
