# How much does it cost? 

For tokens that use TosiDrop services, there is a service fee 1₳ that goes toward TosiDrop revenue. There is also a fee of 0.14₳ that goes to Seal Pool, who developed the backend. Typically, TosiDrop will require the user to send 3.5₳, and you will receive ~2₳ back. The other fees (~0.36₳) come from the Cardano network.

For tokens getting distributed from Vending Machine that do not use TosiDrop services, there is no 1₳ service fee. This means TosiDrop will require the user to send 2.5₳, and you will receive ~2₳ back. The other fees (~0.36₳) come from the Cardano network and 0.14₳ to Seal Pool.

Please note, that some of the ₳ is locked with the tokens that you receive. This is a secruity mechanims in Cardano.
