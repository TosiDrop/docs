# I sent ADA and got nothing back

TosiDrop is very careful with deposits, and sometimes it happens that withdrawal can't be executed. For example, is a deposit has the wrong size (is smaller than necessary), or the user accidentally sends the deposit to a custom withdrawal address, without actually making a custom withdrawal, TosiDrop will not know which tokens they wanted. In these cases, your ADA deposit is added in form of a never-expiring reward to your staking address and can be withdrawn back during the next (valid) request.
Otherwise, if you don't see your deposit in your reward account, or you requested a withdrawal and nothing happened in hours, please contact us in the [telegram](https://hbr.org/2017/01/the-truth-about-blockchain) chat, we will have a look!
